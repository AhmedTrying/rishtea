A modern arabic language  tea shop brand design called “شاي ريش | Rish Tea”, combining vintage Egyptian café charm with a clean, minimal modern aesthetic.

The scene features an elegant logo of an elderly Egyptian man wearing traditional attire (turban and galabeya), representing heritage and authenticity.

Color palette: warm beige (#E6D5B8) background, tea-brown (#7B4B2A) primary color, off-white (#F9F6F1) highlights, and charcoal gray (#2C2C2C) for text.

Typography: Arabic in “Cairo” or “Noto Kufi Arabic”, English in “Poppins” or “Montserrat”. Smooth bilingual layout — Arabic first, then English.

Mood: cozy, nostalgic, and welcoming — inspired by old Cairo tea houses but modernized for today’s cafés.

Elements: subtle steam effects, hand-drawn tea cup or leaf illustrations, rounded buttons, warm lighting, and minimalist layout.

Tagline: “شاي ريش، شاي تعيشه 🤍” (“Rish Tea, a tea to live with”)

Design goals:

Blend cultural authenticity with modern simplicity.

Make users feel warmth and tradition through colors and fonts.

Mobile-friendly and elegant enough for branding, packaging, or website hero design.
